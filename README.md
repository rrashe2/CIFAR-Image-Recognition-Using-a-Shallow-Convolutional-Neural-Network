# CIFAR-Image-Recognition-Using-a-Shallow-Convolutional-Neural-Network
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000
images per class. Similar to the MNIST dataset there are 50000 training images and
10000 test images in the CIFAR-10 Dataset. You can access the CIFAR-10 dataset

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000
images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each
class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some
training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them,
the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.
There are 10 classes {airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck}
in the dataset. The classes are completely mutually exclusive. There is no overlap
between automobiles and trucks. "Automobile" includes sedans, SUVs, things of that
sort. "Truck" includes only big trucks. Neither includes pickup trucks.
